"""MCP resources: the things an agent should be able to read without a tool call.

A tool call is a question the agent has to know to ask. A resource is
context it can be handed. The four here are the things nearly every session
needs before it can do anything useful -- what accounts exist, what
categories exist, who is in the household, and what the numbers mean -- and
making each of them a tool call means every session spends its first three
round trips rediscovering the same facts.

`syllogic://schema` is the one that earns its place several times over. The
field semantics it states are currently spread across forty docstrings, and
the one that matters most -- `category_id` beats `category_system_id` -- is
mentioned in about three of them. An agent that gets that wrong produces
answers that are plausible, confident and wrong, which is the expensive kind.

Balances are deliberately *not* in `syllogic://accounts`. A resource is
cached, and a cached balance is stale by construction; "your balance is
X" where X is an hour old is worse than one more tool call. Names, ids,
types and currencies do not move, so those are here.

# Syllogic data model

Hand-written, not generated. It states the things that are true across every
tool and that an agent cannot infer from a response.

## Amounts

- Decimal numbers in **major units** -- euros, not cents. `-12.5` is twelve
  euros fifty, spent.
- Sign convention: negative is money out, positive is money in. `transaction_type`
  (`"debit"` / `"credit"`) says the same thing and is what aggregates filter on.
- Every amount has a `currency` beside it. Never infer one from the account,
  the user or a sibling field.

## Currency

- Each account holds one currency; a user has one **functional currency** that
  totals are reported in.
- Row-level responses carry the native `amount` + `currency`. Where a converted
  figure exists it is named separately (`functional_amount`, `balance`), with
  the functional currency alongside.
- A row that cannot be stated in the functional currency -- no exchange rate on
  record -- is **excluded** from aggregates rather than added unconverted.
  Aggregates report `unconverted_transaction_count` (or `unconverted_count`,
  or an `unconverted` object) to say how many. Non-zero means the total is an
  undercount and should be reported as one.

## Dates

- `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates, RFC-3339 for instants.
- `from_date` and `to_date` are both **inclusive**. `to_date="2026-09-30"`
  covers all of the 30th, up to 23:59:59.

## Categories -- the rule most worth knowing

A transaction carries two category fields:

- `category_id` -- the **user's override**. Set by a person, or by an agent
  through `update_transaction_category`.
- `category_system_id` -- the **AI's assignment**, made at import.

**The effective category is `category_id` when it is set, and
`category_system_id` otherwise.** Every aggregate in this server follows that
rule. Reading only `category_id` undercounts; reading only
`category_system_id` ignores every correction the user has ever made. Both
mistakes produce numbers that look right.

`update_transaction_category` writes `category_id`, so it always wins, and it
never destroys the AI's guess.

## Transfers

Movements between the user's own accounts are not spending. They are excluded
from analytics via `include_in_analytics=false`, except for the
`savings_transfer` and `investment_transfer` system categories, which a budget
may deliberately track.

## Writes

- Every write tool takes `dry_run`. It applies the change, reports it, and
  rolls it back -- so the preview reflects constraints, not guesses.
- Single-entity writes answer with `changed`, `before`, `after` and
  `fields_changed`. `changed: false` means it was already that way; say so
  rather than claiming an edit.
- `create_*` and `update_*` take `idempotency_key`. Reuse it to retry safely;
  the same key with different arguments is rejected.

## Failures

Tools raise rather than returning an error body. There is no `success` field
to check. Error messages carry the way out: the allowed values, the candidate
ids, or the expected format.

## Picking a tool

- Totals by category, optionally per month: `get_amounts_by_category`.
- Rows matching text: `search_transactions` (pass `queries` for several terms
  at once, and `match_mode="word"` for merchant names).
- Rows matching a plain filter, no text: `list_transactions`.
- Tools whose description begins DEPRECATED still work for one release. Use
  what they point at.
