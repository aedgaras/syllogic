"""Postgres-backed request throttling.

Deliberately simple (fixed-window counters via an atomic upsert) rather than a
sliding-window or token-bucket scheme -- this is meant to stop obvious abuse
(credential stuffing, cost-burning LLM spam, unauthenticated key-guessing),
not to be a precise limiter.

Counters live in the "rate_limit_counters" table (UNLOGGED -- see
frontend/lib/db/migrations/0042_rate_limit_counters.manual.sql), one row per
key. window_start tracks which fixed window the count belongs to; the upsert
resets the count when the window has rolled over instead of relying on a
separate expiry.

Fails open: if the database is unreachable, requests are allowed through and
a warning is logged. Rate limiting is a defense-in-depth layer here, not a
hard dependency -- it must not become a new way to take the app down.
