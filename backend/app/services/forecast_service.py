"""Deterministic cash-flow / balance projection engine.

Pure functions only — no DB access here, mirroring pnl_service.py's split
(callers gather data from SQLAlchemy, this module just does math). A cash
forecast combines two legs:

  1. "known" — active RecurringTransaction rows, walked forward via
     compute_next_due_date(). Direction comes from `RecurringDefinition.is_income`
     (set by the caller from Category.category_type — see routes/forecast.py):
     income rows add to the balance, everything else (expense/transfer/no
     category) subtracts, matching what tasks/recurring_transaction_tasks.py
     actually materializes.
  2. "variable" — everything else, projected forward as a flat trailing
     daily average (see routes/forecast.py for how that average, and its
     stddev, are computed — excluding transactions already linked to a
     recurring definition, to avoid double-counting them).

Both legs are summed into a daily cumulative balance series starting from
the current summed account balance. A confidence band around that mid line
is derived from the trailing daily net's stddev under a random-walk
assumption (daily nets i.i.d.): band width at day t is `z * stddev *
sqrt(t)`. The recurring leg is deterministic and shifts low/mid/high
equally — it contributes no variance. No trend/seasonality modeling.

Investment/savings (growth) accounts are projected separately by
`project_compounding_balance`, using a flat historical daily rate derived
from AccountBalance history rather than transactions, since their balance
moves mainly via price change, not postings. The route sums both legs.
